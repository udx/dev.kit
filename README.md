# dev-kit

Local engineering kit for bootstrapping and orchestrating developer workflows.

Goals:
- Centralize small local scripts and workflows.
- Keep commands human- and agent-friendly.
- Evolve incrementally with review.

Planned features (draft):
- Middleware for local actions (commands, web requests) with allow/deny policies.
- Configurable permissions file generated by the CLI.
- Temporary CLI alias management for session-scoped tools.
- Context helpers for Codex and local standards.
- Experience logging helpers (CDE-aligned, reviewed updates).
- Safe redaction and secrets handling.
- Bootstrap UDX environment without heavy edits to `.bash_profile`:
  - Generate config files under `~/.engineering/dev-kit/`
  - Offer optional integration via `source` of generated files
  - Keep user-confirmed, reviewable changes
