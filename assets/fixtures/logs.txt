# Skill Installer

Helps install skills. By default these are from https://github.com/openai/skills/tree/main/skills/.curated, but users can also provide other locations.

Use the helper scripts based on the task:
- List curated skills when the user asks what is available, or if the user uses this skill without specifying what to do.
- Install from the curated list when the user provides a skill name.
- Install from another repo when the user provides a GitHub repo/path (including private repos).

Install skills with the helper scripts.

**Locating local installer script**

I'm searching for a local installer script in the skills/workflow-generator directory to install the skill to /.codex/skills as the user requested.

**Explaining sandbox write limitations**

Writing to user home is blocked by sandbox, so I'll provide instructions for the user to manually copy or create needed files outside the sandbox, including commands and restart advice.
codex
I used the installer script, but the sandbox blocks writing to `~/.codex/skills`, so the copy failed.

What I ran:
```bash
bash scripts/install-codex-skill.sh skills/workflow-generator workflow-generator "$HOME/.codex/skills"
```

To complete the install outside the sandbox, run the same command in your shell. It should create `~/.codex/skills/workflow-generator/SKILL.md` and then you can restart Codex to pick up the new skill.

If you want me to install it into a writable location inside this repo instead, tell me where.
