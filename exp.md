I’ll use the `dev-kit-prompt-router` skill, but I’m blocked because the required docs aren’t present in this repo. Please provide the required docs or tell me where to find them in this workspace:

- `docs/index.md`
- `docs/execution/prompt-as-workflow.md`
- `docs/execution/iteration-loop.md`
- `docs/cde/output-contracts.md`
- `docs/execution/workflow-io-schema.md`
