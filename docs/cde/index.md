# CDE

Domain: CDE

## Purpose

Define the canonical CDE contracts that make repositories executable,
versioned, and handler-safe.

## Scope

- CDE artifacts are the only surface exposed to reasoning systems.
- Artifacts are explicit, versioned, and validated.
- Determinism lives at execution boundaries and artifact interfaces.
- Canonical intent may exist in docs, but access is mediated through CDE artifacts.
- Prompts are first-class artifacts with stable interfaces.
