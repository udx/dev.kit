# UDX Reference Index

## Summary

This index maps reference material to common dev.kit and engineering decisions. Use it to find the right source of truth fast.

## How To Use

- Start with the topic page that matches your question.
- Use UDX guidance for general practice and guardrails.
- Use external standards only for tool-specific details.

## Common Questions Map

- "Where should config live?" -> `12-factor.md`, `yaml-standards.md`
- "How do we scale delivery?" -> `devops-littles-law.md`, `lifecycle-cheatsheet.md`
- "How do we handle supply chain risk?" -> `supply-chain-security.md`
- "How should we define standards?" -> `aoca-guidance.md`, `devops-manual-guidance.md`
- "What is cATO and do we need it?" -> `cato-overview.md`
- "Where do external tool rules live?" -> `external-standards.md`
- "Which layer does this belong to?" -> `layers.md`

## Reference Groups

- Engineering principles: `principles.md`, `layers.md`
- Operational practices: `lifecycle-cheatsheet.md`, `devops-littles-law.md`
- Configuration standards: `12-factor.md`, `yaml-standards.md`
- Security and compliance: `supply-chain-security.md`, `cato-overview.md`
