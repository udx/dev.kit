# UDX Worker Ecosystem References

## Summary

A reference map for the UDX Worker ecosystem. Use this when dev.kit needs to align with worker runtimes, configs, or deployment tooling.

## When To Use

- Adding worker-related modules or commands.
- Validating worker config schemas.
- Referencing official runtime behavior.

## Quick Answers

- "Where is runtime behavior defined?" -> runtime-specific docs.
- "How do we configure services?" -> config and service references.
- "Where do examples live?" -> example repos, not specs.

## Reference Areas

- Core runtimes: base runtime and language-specific runtimes.
- Deployment and CLI tools.
- Configuration and authorization formats.
- Examples and playbooks.

## dev.kit Notes

- Treat runtime and config docs as sources of truth.
- Use examples only as patterns, not as specs.
