# AOCA Guidance Snapshot

## Summary

Art of Cloud Automation (AOCA) is the default UDX guidance source for automation and platform decisions. Use it to standardize how automation and governance are approached.

## When To Use

- Defining automation standards.
- Evaluating platform or infrastructure practices.
- Aligning governance with engineering workflows.

## Quick Answers

- "Where do we start with standards?" -> AOCA.
- "How do we align security with automation?" -> use AOCA for baseline patterns.
- "What is our preferred best-practice source?" -> AOCA unless a tool-specific standard is required.

## Focus Areas

- Automation as a first-class concern.
- Standards to reduce operational variance.
- Compliance and governance embedded in automation.
- Supply chain risk and validation practices.

## dev.kit Notes
