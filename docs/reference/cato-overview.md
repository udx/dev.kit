# cATO Overview

## Summary

Continuous Authorization to Operate (cATO) replaces point-in-time approvals with continuous, automated evidence. It aligns compliance with delivery workflows.

## When To Use

- Designing compliance-friendly pipelines.
- Defining evidence collection and audit trails.
- Integrating governance with CI/CD.

## Quick Answers

- "What is cATO?" -> continuous compliance via automated evidence.
- "What changes for teams?" -> controls move into pipelines.
- "Why now?" -> faster delivery with ongoing assurance.

## Practical Implications

- Controls must be measurable and observable.
- Pipelines should produce compliance evidence.
- Configuration drift needs detection and remediation.
- Risk acceptance is explicit and tracked.

## dev.kit Notes

- Store evidence and reports in state, not source.
- Keep workflows traceable with explicit inputs/outputs.
