# Best Practices

## 2026-01-29

- Keep Mermaid markup aligned with repo style (flowchart TD, short labels, `<br/>` for line breaks).
- Prefer prompt-as-workflow structure with bounded steps and explicit inputs/outputs.
- Store diagram sources alongside articles and reference SVGs from the article body.

- For GitHub Pages "dynamic" sections, use a static JSON index and client-side fetch.
- Generate the index from `research/**/index.html` so pages self-describe via `<title>` or `<h1>`.
