# Best Practices

## 2026-01-29
- Keep dense dashboards compact by reducing padding, gaps, and minimum heights.
- Anchor auxiliary notices (like theme jokes) with absolute positioning to avoid layout shifts.
- Prefer integrated micro-widgets (tip in hero) over separate sections to reduce visual noise.
- Provide simple tab switches for related datasets to avoid long stacked lists.
