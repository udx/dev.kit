# Development Standards

Core Standards
- Modularization of logic with reusable, isolated units and graceful fallbacks.
- TDD: define expectations first and use tests to guide iteration.
- Configs live outside the codebase and remain user-managed.

Implementation Notes
- Prefer small, reviewable changes.
- Keep tooling optional and detect capabilities before use.
