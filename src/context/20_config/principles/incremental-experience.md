# Incremental Experience Methodology

Purpose
- Build iteratively while preserving learnings from every success or failure.
- Reuse experience context across iterations without forcing it as source of truth.

Core Ideas
- Each iteration produces artifacts, observations, and decisions.
- Not all artifacts should be reused directly; some are superseded or partial.
- The accumulated experience is always valuable for guiding the next iteration.

Process
- Capture outcomes and gaps at the end of each iteration.
- Store experience context separately from active sources.
- Use experience as guidance, not as a hard dependency.
