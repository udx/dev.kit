# AI Skills (Common)

Purpose
- Define AI-agnostic skills that can be selected and formatted per client.

Sources
- `src/context/30_module/ai/skills/devkit-install-cleanup.md`

Notes
- Codex requires repo/user skill directories with `SKILL.md` files.
- Client builds should format and package these sources into `public/modules/ai/<client>/skills.md`.
- Use consistent headings across skills to keep navigation uniform:
  - Goal, Scope, Preflight, Validate, Cleanup, Notes.
