        "- **Codex**: This prompt is intended for Codex CLI usage.",
        "- **Normalization**: Prefer prompts generated by `dev.kit prompt` so Codex rules are normalized consistently.",
        "- **Codex Config**: If `dev.kit codex apply` has been run, assume `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` and `~/.codex/rules/default.rules` are authoritative.",
        "- **Tips and Shortcuts**:",
        "  - Prefix a line with `!` to run a local shell command (for example, `!ls`). Codex treats the output like a user-provided command result and still applies approval and sandbox settings. Use this only in interactive sessions; for `codex exec`, include needed command output in the prompt ahead of time.",
        "  - Type `@` to open fuzzy file search over the workspace root; use `Tab` or `Enter` to insert the highlighted path.",
        "  - Press `Enter` while Codex is running to inject instructions into the current turn, or press `Tab` to queue a follow-up prompt.",
        "  - Tap `Esc` twice with an empty composer to edit your previous message; keep pressing `Esc` to walk back and `Enter` to fork.",
        "  - Use slash commands (for example, `/review` or `/fork`) to jump into specialized workflows.",
        "  - Launch with `codex --cd <path>` to set the working root, and `--add-dir` to expose more writable roots.",
        "  - Prepare your environment before launching Codex (virtualenvs, daemons, env vars) to avoid extra probing."
